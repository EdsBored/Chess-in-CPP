# Chess-in-C++

This is a game I made in C++
To play use commands in a 5 letter format: "e2 e4" will move the piece on e2 to the square e4 unless it is blocked

This is an early version! Here are some updates that will be done in the near future:
Implementation of Checkmate
Implementation of the Queen being able to move correctly
Bug Fixes

This is all that is planned for as of now, however I am bug testing and reaching out to friends so I can possibly make new updates and new game modes that use the same pieces

Ideas of this (Though not promises)

Chaos mode: All pieces spawn in at random locations with a random amount (1-3) of each except pawn that will be <6

Puzzle mode: Set puzzle mode that tests skill and knowledge of the game

King is the Strongest: The king acts like a Queen, and the Queen acts like the King. 
I always wondered what would happen if the King piece was the piece on the offensive, would the game be more aggressive? 
Or would it end up being more passive? Maybe it wouldn't change at all?

Total War Mode: There is no checkmate, the King can be taken and sacrificed, you must take all the opponents pieces to win. 
This just seems interesting to me, and since it's kind of like this right now it'd be easy to implement.

Server: Being able to play with others over the internet is crucial in multiplayer games, 
and I would like to implement this at some point (Once again, no promises)

The most likely to be added is Total War Mode, and least likely is the addition of Servers. 
As much as I'd like to implement servers, there is Chess.com for that, and it would really only be a consideration if I do go through with the modes above.
